# ML-Final-Project
The novelty of UVMs semiconductor engineering program has posed many limitations to microelectronic fabrication. This project uses pass fail data from MEMS resonators manufactured at UVM to train various classification models to predict areas on the wafer with high probability of failure based on device complexity.
