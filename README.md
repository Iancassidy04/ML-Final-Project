# ML-Final-Project
The novelty of UVMs semiconductor engineering program has posed many limitations to microelectronic fabrication. This project uses pass fail data from MEMS resonators manufactured at UVM to train various classification models to predict areas on the wafer with high probability of failure based on device complexity.

Scripts for model optimatizon iterate around parameters and calculates accuracy to find the best parameters. Failure mapping makes predictions for points on a wafer space using the optimized parameters from RFC optimizations and plots as a scatter plot using red for failure and green for pass.
